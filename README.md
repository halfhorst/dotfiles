# dotfiles

I'm sick of setting up dotfiles over and over and trying to remember the things I
like. Hopefully, this will get me up and running on a new computer easy. It's
organized by platform on different branches. So far I only have a need for an Ubuntu
setup, but I'll add some more branches when the time comes.


## TODO
- [ ]  Install autokey automatically on linux systems and map capslock to ctrl
- [ ]  Add inventory of plugins included
- [ ]  Add lazygit and gotop
- [ ]  Swap neovim for vim

## Vim plugins to check out
- [ ] gruvbox
- [ ] deoplete.vim
- [ ] fzf.vim
