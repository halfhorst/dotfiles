# dotfiles

All the things I like for a cozy terminal experience, managed with `make` and `stow`.

I'm sick of setting up dotfiles over and over and trying to remember the things I
like. Hopefully, this will get me up and running on a new computer easy. It's
organized by platform on different branches. So far I only have a need for an Ubuntu
setup, but I'll add some more branches when the time comes.
