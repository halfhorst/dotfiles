# dotfiles

I work on serveral different computers and never quite got my Ubuntu setup the same
between them. I got sick of the different configurations and built an idempotent
shell script that will get me up-and-running with a basic setup. So far I only have
a need for an Ubuntu setup, but I'll add some more branches when the time comes.

What it does:
-------------
* gives me zsh and oh-my-zsh
* symlinks config dotfiles
* installs some command line applications that I like
* installs some system fonts that I like
* configures my terminal emulator of choice, hyper
* copies over my terminal splash pictures!

## TODO
- [X]  Move path manipulations to separate, ignored file
- [X]  Add source computer splash logo
- [ ]  Add lazygit
- [ ]  Add gotop
- [ ]  Finish up vimrc
- [ ]  Swap neovim for vim
